        <h2>What is Judgment?</h2>
        <p>Judgment is the ability to make better decisions consistently over time. Naval Ravikant emphasizes that good judgment is critical for success in life and business. It is about understanding the fundamental principles of a problem and applying them effectively.</p>

        <h2>Key Principles for Building Judgment</h2>
        <p>Naval suggests several strategies to cultivate sound judgment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Learn to Think from First Principles:</strong> Break problems down to their basics and reason from the ground up.</li>
            <li><strong>Read Widely:</strong> Gain diverse knowledge across disciplines to see patterns and make connections.</li>
            <li><strong>Work on Foundational Knowledge:</strong> Focus on understanding timeless truths rather than chasing trends.</li>
            <li><strong>Leverage Feedback:</strong> Learn from mistakes and refine your approach.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Judgment Matters</h2>
        <p>Good judgment amplifies leverage. It allows you to make decisions that multiply your time, energy, and resources. Naval emphasizes that people with excellent judgment become indispensable in any field because their decisions consistently yield high returns.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"The ability to make accurate, unemotional decisions is one of the rarest and most valuable traits."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>How to Practice Judgment</h2>
        <p>Practicing judgment requires patience and effort. Here are some practical tips:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Develop a mental model library to approach different problems systematically.</li>
            <li>Surround yourself with people who have strong judgment and learn from them.</li>
            <li>Embrace failure as a teacher; analyze your mistakes to improve.</li>
            <li>Take time to think deeply and avoid rushed decisions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Building judgment is a lifelong endeavor. By committing to learning, thinking critically, and staying curious, you can improve your decision-making and unlock new opportunities for success.</p>
