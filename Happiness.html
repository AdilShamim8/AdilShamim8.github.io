        <h2>What is Happiness?</h2>
        <p>According to Naval Ravikant, happiness is a state of being that comes from within, rather than something we achieve from external sources. True happiness is the ability to find peace and contentment regardless of external circumstances.</p>

        <h2>Key Principles of Happiness</h2>
        <p>Naval emphasizes several timeless principles to achieve happiness:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Detach from Desire:</strong> Happiness is not in acquiring things but in wanting less.</li>
            <li><strong>Live in the Present:</strong> Embrace the now instead of worrying about the past or the future.</li>
            <li><strong>Know Yourself:</strong> Understanding your values and goals can lead to inner peace.</li>
            <li><strong>Practice Gratitude:</strong> Focusing on what you have rather than what you lack fosters contentment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Happiness vs. Pleasure</h2>
        <p>Naval differentiates between fleeting pleasure and lasting happiness. He argues that pleasure often comes from external sources and is short-lived, while happiness is a deeper, more enduring state that comes from self-knowledge and acceptance.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"A calm mind, a fit body, and a house full of love. These things cannot be bought. They must be earned."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Practices to Cultivate Happiness</h2>
        <p>Here are practical steps to build happiness:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start a daily gratitude practice to focus on positive aspects of your life.</li>
            <li>Meditate regularly to calm your mind and improve self-awareness.</li>
            <li>Engage in physical exercise to boost your mood and overall well-being.</li>
            <li>Spend time with loved ones and build meaningful connections.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Happiness is not a destination but a journey. By focusing on internal growth, aligning with your values, and letting go of external dependencies, you can create a fulfilling and happy life.</p>
